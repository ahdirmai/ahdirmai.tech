    content: `# Building Modern Web Applications with React and TypeScript

In today's rapidly evolving web development landscape, creating scalable and maintainable applications is more important than ever. React and TypeScript have emerged as a powerful combination that enables developers to build robust, type-safe applications with excellent developer experience.

## Why React and TypeScript?

React has revolutionized how we think about building user interfaces, introducing concepts like component-based architecture and declarative programming. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, catching errors at compile time and providing better tooling support.

### Benefits of Using TypeScript with React

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors before they reach production
2. **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring
3. **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as documentation
4. **Easier Refactoring**: Confident code changes with type checking

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

\`\`\`bash
# Create a new React app with TypeScript
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

# Or with Vite (recommended)
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### 1. Component Structure

Always define clear interfaces for your component props:

\`\`\`typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  disabled?: boolean;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  children, 
  onClick, 
  variant = 'primary',
  disabled = false 
}) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={\`btn btn-\${variant}\`}
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
\`\`\`

### 2. State Management

Use proper typing for your state:

\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
\`\`\`

## Advanced Patterns

### Custom Hooks

Create reusable logic with custom hooks:

\`\`\`typescript
function useApi<T>(url: string) {
  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(setData)
      .catch(err => setError(err.message))
      .finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

React and TypeScript together provide a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. The combination offers type safety, better developer experience, and more maintainable code. Start small, gradually adopt TypeScript features, and you'll see the benefits in your development workflow.

Happy coding! ðŸš€`,

    content: `# The Future of Web Development: Trends to Watch in 2024

Web development is evolving at an unprecedented pace. As we move through 2024, several key trends are reshaping how we build and interact with web applications. Let's explore the most significant developments that every developer should be aware of.

## 1. AI-Powered Development Tools

Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the development process:

- **Code Generation**: Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are helping developers write code faster
- **Automated Testing**: AI can generate comprehensive test suites

    content: `# Design Systems: Creating Consistent User Experiences

Consistency is key to creating great user experiences. Design systems provide the foundation for building cohesive, scalable, and maintainable digital products. In this article, we'll explore how to create and implement effective design systems.

## What is a Design System?

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. It includes:

- **Design Tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing, and other design decisions
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components
- **Guidelines**: Rules and best practices for using the system
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for implementation

## Benefits of Design Systems

### 1. Consistency
- Unified visual language across all products
- Reduced design debt
- Better brand recognition

### 2. Efficiency
- Faster design and development cycles
- Reduced duplication of effort
- Easier maintenance and updates

### 3. Scalability
- Easy to onboard new team members
- Consistent quality across teams
- Simplified decision-making process

## Building Your Design System

### Step 1: Audit Your Current Design
- Identify existing patterns and inconsistencies
- Document current components and styles
- Gather feedback from stakeholders

### Step 2: Define Design Tokens
\`\`\`css
:root {
  /* Colors */
  --color-primary: #007bff;
  --color-secondary: #6c757d;
  --color-success: #28a745;
  
  /* Typography */
  --font-family-base: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  --font-size-base: 16px;
  --line-height-base: 1.5;
  
  /* Spacing */
  --spacing-xs: 4px;
  --spacing-sm: 8px;
  --spacing-md: 16px;
  --spacing-lg: 24px;
}
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Create Component Library
Build reusable components with clear APIs:

\`\`\`jsx
const Button = ({ 
  variant = 'primary', 
  size = 'medium', 
  children, 
  ...props 
}) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={\`btn btn--\${variant} btn--\${size}\`}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Document Everything
- Component usage examples
- Do's and don'ts
- Accessibility guidelines
- Implementation notes

## Tools for Design Systems

### Design Tools
- **Figma**: Collaborative design with component libraries
- **Sketch**: Vector-based design with symbols
- **Adobe XD**: Prototyping and design systems

### Development Tools
- **Storybook**: Component development and documentation
- **Bit**: Component sharing and collaboration
- **Chromatic**: Visual testing for components

## Maintaining Your Design System

### 1. Governance
- Establish clear ownership and responsibilities
- Create contribution guidelines
- Regular review and update processes

### 2. Adoption
- Provide training and support
- Create migration guides
- Monitor usage and gather feedback

### 3. Evolution
- Regular audits and improvements
- Stay updated with design trends
- Adapt to new requirements and technologies

## Conclusion

Design systems are essential for creating consistent, efficient, and scalable digital products. By investing time in building and maintaining a robust design system, teams can focus more on solving user problems and less on reinventing design solutions.

Remember, a design system is never truly finishedâ€”it's a living, breathing part of your product ecosystem that should evolve with your needs.
